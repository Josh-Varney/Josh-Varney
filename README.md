👋 Hi, I’m Josh Varney!
🎓 About Me
I have been immersed in computer science for over eight years, culminating in a First Class BSc in Computer Science. Currently, I work as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at Confluent, where I help build scalable and resilient systems. My professional journey includes impactful internships at Tradeweb, where I contributed to enhancing automation in electronic trading processes, collaborating with leading firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity. My deep passion for technology and commitment to continuous learning fuel my drive to solve real-world problems through innovative, forward-thinking solutions. 

For my dissertation, I developed a decentralized application (dApp) on the Ethereum testnet to simulate fractional ownership of real estate. This project demonstrated how Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms safeguard distributed nodes and ledgers, ensuring the integrity and security of internationally dispersed transactions.

- C++ (Personal Favourite)
  
🔍 Current Focus
In my role, I will be managing thousands of Docker containers and deploying servers globally, collaborating with major corporations such as Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of clients. I’m particularly interested in deepening my understanding of resource balancing in data streaming platforms like Apache Kafka, as I see this as a valuable and impactful area for my career growth. Looking ahead, I aim to explore opportunities in the fintech sector and pursue personal initiatives—such as launching a software company or developing my own technology brand.
