👋 Hi, I’m Josh Varney!
🎓 About Me
I have been immersed in computer science for over eight years, culminating in a First Class BSc in Computer Science from the University of Portsmouth. Currently, I work as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer Intern at Confluent, where I help build scalable and resilient autonomous systems for internal company processes. My professional journey includes impactful internships, including one at Tradeweb, where I contributed to enhancing automation in electronic trading processes. I designed and implemented automated validation and monitoring systems to reduce errors in static and dynamic configurations across the organization, while collaborating with leading firms within the fixed income division. My deep passion for technology and commitment to continuous learning fuel my drive to solve real-world problems through innovative, forward-thinking solutions. 

For my dissertation, I developed a decentralized application (dApp) on the Ethereum testnet to simulate fractional ownership of real estate. This project demonstrated how Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms safeguard distributed nodes and ledgers, ensuring the integrity and security of internationally dispersed transactions.

🌱 Technologies I’m Learning and Working with Daily
- Golang (GO)
- TypeScript (Personal Favourite)
- C++ 
  
🔍 Current Focus
In my role, I will be managing thousands of Docker containers and deploying servers globally, collaborating with major corporations across the globe. I’m particularly interested in deepening my understanding of resource balancing in data streaming platforms like Apache Kafka, as I see this as a valuable and impactful area for my career growth. Looking ahead, I aim to explore opportunities in the fintech sector and pursue personal initiatives—such as launching a software company or developing my own technology brand.
